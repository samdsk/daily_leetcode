### 258. Add Digits

[Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root)

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

formula: for O(1)

0 if n == 0
1 + ((n-1) mod (base - 1))

Example 1:

    Input: num = 38
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The process is
    38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
    11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
    Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Example 2:

    Input: num = 0
    Output: 0



Constraints:

    0 <= num <= 231 - 1
