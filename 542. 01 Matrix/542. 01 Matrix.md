Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.



Example 1:

    Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
    Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/01-2-grid.jpg)

    Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
    Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]



Constraints:

    m == mat.length
    n == mat[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 104
    1 <= m * n <= 104
    mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
    There is at least one 0 in mat.
